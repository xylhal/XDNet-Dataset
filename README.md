# XDNet Dataset

This repository contains the link to the re-formulated dataset used in the paper "XDNet: A Few-Shot Meta-Learning Approach for Cross-Domain Visual Inspection" presented in the CVPR 2023 Vision Workshop.

This dataset is adapted from the MVTec data (originally used for anomaly detection) for few-shot cross-domain meta-learning.

This repository will be updated soon.
